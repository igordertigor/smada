# smada - Statistics, Machine learning And Data Analysis

This is a loose collection of data science tools that I implemented. Reasons for implementing could be
1. I couldn't find an implementation elsewhere on the web.
2. I found an implementation, but it didn't quite meet my needs.
3. I wanted to learn something by implementing the algorithm.

Most implementations will not cover *all* possible usecases, but they should at least cover some.

I made an attempt to structure the interfaces in a way that makes them
campatible with [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org).
